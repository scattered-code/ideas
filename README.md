### rating system (metadata) on news articles
browser plugin that adds the necessary visual elements to the page.. on the page you have the writer of the article and rate the article by multiple categories such as accuracy, political party favored / or view leaning, and each person with the plugin also has their own score computed based on the articles they interact with and how they rate.. published on a blockchain of course, and you compute an article score based on all of those 

The publisher uses their self-sovereign identity to sign each article they post. The rating sysetm works with publishers which earned their rating / stats based on how many articles they published, length of time, party favored, identity factors of any user who rated them (users who rate also need to sign the rating with their own self-sovereign identity).

### DNA pirated movie crisis
China published 6 papers on how to encode (and encrypt) information in DNA
we can do it with bacteria DNA or human DNA
encode a bunch of movies in DNA and infect a whole bunch of people, and make the method easily available for anyone to extract that info
process is quite simple, needs a crispr kit and spectrograph? to read the data
then send all the info to DMCA in video format via youtube with a lot of evil laughing and stand by
