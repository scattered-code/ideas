### rating system (metadata) on news articles
browser plugin that adds the necessary visual elements to the page.. on the page you have the writer of the article and rate the article by multiple categories such as accuracy, political party favored / or view leaning, and each person with the plugin also has their own score computed based on the articles they interact with and how they rate.. published on a blockchain of course, and you compute an article score based on all of those 

The publisher uses their self-sovereign identity to sign each article they post. The rating sysetm works with publishers which earned their rating / stats based on how many articles they published, length of time, party favored, identity factors of any user who rated them (users who rate also need to sign the rating with their own self-sovereign identity).

### DNA pirated movie crisis
China published 6 papers on how to encode (and encrypt) information in DNA
we can do it with bacteria DNA or human DNA
encode a bunch of movies in DNA and infect a whole bunch of people, and make the method easily available for anyone to extract that info
process is quite simple, needs a crispr kit and spectrograph? to read the data
then send all the info to DMCA in video format via youtube with a lot of evil laughing and stand by

### Password-less server-initiated protected resource sharing
known: enter email, new key pair is created and stored in the browser and registered on a blockchain, get link in email which has the verifying authority vouch for that DID on the same blockchain with zksnarks
- this requires the user to start the process
new idea: send the user a link with a token, when they click it, you generate that key-value pair in their browser and in any other browsers that they click it on for the duration of its validity, then for as long as that browser has its data, the user can access the protected resource. if they land on that page after the link is expired and they're using a new browser, then just prompt for email and go with that first process
- this applies to things like sending someone a link to a protected resource, with the user only having to click on one link and get access to the resource

### Metaverse meeting rooms
Offer metaverse meeting rooms. You can book the room online with a calendarly.com-type experience, customize the room with your branding or display ads on the walls. It would pair with your headset and calendar, and clicking join would open the app when it's time and join you into the room
